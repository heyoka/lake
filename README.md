# Erlang and Elixir RabbitMQ Streams Connectors

See `lake` for the Erlang RabbitMQ Streams Connector and `lake_house` for the Elixir RabbitMQ Streams Connector.

## Naming

A stream feeds a lake, and a lake feeds a stream. Standing at a lake, there is a lake house, which makes things even prettier.
